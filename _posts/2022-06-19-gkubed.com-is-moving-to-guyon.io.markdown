After some consideration, I decided to pull the trigger on a different domain name - [guyon.io](https://guyon.io). In the event that you have gkubed.com bookmarked or a subscription to it with RSS (💕), do move those to [guyon.io](https://guyon.io). This is because [guyon.io](https://guyon.io) is *way* more memorable than gkubed.com, and most people don't know what gkubed is (I'm Guyon the third - G³). Additionally, on bigger screens, images should now be bigger and higher quality - and load faster too! In fact, every image on the site was tracked down and re-exported - which took *forever* but was time well invested.
