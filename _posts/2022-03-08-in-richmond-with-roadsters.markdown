Over the years I've befriended people with some really cool cars here in Richmond, Virginia. Given all the time in the world, I'd love to schedule shoots with everyone and put together articles on this site for each of them, even if it meant hours upon hours of figuring out how to compliment the pictures with words. All that said, my time is not infinite, so when an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone appears, I take it.

This is Chris Larson's 2003 Honda S2000 (AP1). The last time you saw this car was in my [last post](../../../../2021/10/30/nightrun-garage-open-house-2021/) back in October. Given that in that album it's pictured looking largely stock, you can trust that Chris works on his car a lot faster than I can churn out posts.

Around that same time, Chris let me take his S2000 for a spin on the roads outside VIR and it was a blast to drive. With the wider wheels, stickier tires, and better brakes, it's gotta be even more fun now.

And this beauty is Steve Killmon's 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata (ND1). It's largely stock compared to the S2000 (whose mod list is said to be longer than my leg, according to Steve), but it has all the essentials. And it's a Miata after all, it doesn't really *need* anything.

Perhaps most notably, Steve wrapped his Miata in an XPEL Stealth Satin paint protection film. It looks as great in person as it does in the photos and greatly contrasts the mirror finish of Chris' Silverstone Metallic S2000. In the wheel department, the car rests on bronze 17x8" König Ampliforms wrapped in 225 width Pilot Sport 4's.

We met for burgers before our shoot and headed downtown, ditching my NA Miata (more on that car at a future date, hopefully) in a nearby parking garage. This alley is one of my favorite spots to shoot at, and I've never seen another photographer use it to date.

I was a little afraid these photos would be unusable as there was less light left in the sky than I anticipated. Shooting at 1/20 isn't impossible thanks to a lens with image stabilization, but I was still relieved to get home and see they came out pretty sharp.

We booked it out of the alley in pursuit of shooting elsewhere while there was still daylight and quickly found ourselves shooting by The Martin Agency.

Chris recently mounted a set of 17x9" WedSport TC105X's on his car with my favorite 200TW tire, the Hankook Ventus RS4. Just the day before our shoot he redid his brakes with DBA rotors and Project Mu pads. The calipers were rebuilt and recoated locally by TaikyuSpec.

We continued our trek east and made our last daylight stop at Richmond's Main Street Station with the S2000 in the spotlight first. You wouldn't think a sports car prepared like this one would look so at home amidst 1901 architecture, yet here we are.

What a vibe." %}

All the while I was shooting the Honda, Steve's Miata sat patiently nearby. Isn't it just adorable?

Finally, it was the ND's turn at the bat, right as the sun was reaching the skyline. Richmond really is a breathtaking city, and having a Miata in the foreground only makes it better.

When it became too dark for me to handhold the camera, I broke out the tripod for some detail shots of the S2000's engine bay. Chris has gone to great lengths to make this vehicle as beautiful on the inside as much as it is on the outside. It features the AutoTeknic carbon cooling plate, the Nightrun Garage coolant overflow tank they developed in-house, Renegade Motorsports VTEC solenoid cover and titanium battery tiedown, as well as other goodies. The accessories are neatly attached with Dress Up Bolts hardware.

Before heading out, I snagged a few more pictures of the Miata.

To end our night, we followed I-95 South from below and took a few shots in Shockoe Bottom and then some obligatory photos at the Church Hill Overlook, where I had more fun taking pictures of the cars blurred in motion than I did them sitting still. I hadn't thought about it at the time, but I hadn't taken photos at night since H2Oi 2018! I think I got the hang of it though, eventually.

It was a good night - especially since we finished it by enjoying some ice cream at Sweet Spot Ice Cream Cafe. Thanks Chris and Steve for letting me shoot your cars, and thank *you*, dear reader, for following along. Below you'll find their respective mod lists and more bonus photos at the end ❤.
