It's hard to describe why I'm not a huge supercar person. I respect them, they will always make me turn my head, and I'll always point them out, but, given the choice between a $100,000 car and a $20,000 car with $80,000 of work done to it, I will almost always prefer the latter. Maybe I'm getting old, or maybe I'm just plain wrong, but that's just how Guyon typically operates. Seeing the latest exotic model is always a little special the first time, but I grow bored knowing that there are others like it.

I rolled into Cars and Coffee on Saturday at 8:10. It was cold. The roof on my Scion FR-S was adorned in frost. Edges of my windshield still revealed my choppy scraping job. I climbed out of my car with my camera intending to greet my friend Matt. Before we had really finished saying "hi", my eyesight was forcibly interrupted by *it*.

*It* was the purple spoiler of a McLaren that poked up just over the trunklid of a neighboring BMW M4. Since I don't meticulously follow auto news like I did when I was in high school, I ashamedly couldn't identify which McLaren model I was looking at before close inspection.

Congratulations, McLaren. You got my attention.

I'm a millennial, so I did my part in keeping stereotypes alive by posting a picture of it on my Instagram story. Not too long after this, I received a reply from my close friend Chris Reilly: "your challenge today is to accurately capture this color". "You're on", I replied.

Mauvine Blue is a paint color mixed by McLaren Special Operations - a personalization service for McLaren customers. I do not know the exact cost of this paint option, but I know it's somewhere along what you'd pay for a brand new Honda Fit. When you're throwing upwards of $300,000 on a car, that's not too bad, I suppose.

When you walk up to the car in person, it's overwhelmingly purple. Everyone, myself included, who didn't know the name of the color beforehand was a little baffled upon hearing it. I had to pull out my phone to double check what I was told.

Long before the McLaren 720S was a thing, and even a bit before the first automobile, the 18 year old William Henry Perkin was on a quest to find a method to treat malaria. While trying to perform [quinine total synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine_total_synthesis), he accidentally produced an intense purple dye. Having been dabbling in painting and photography for years, he knew he had come upon an amazing discovery - the first synthetic dye. He called it *mauveine*.

You may see why the color's name, Mauvine Blue ("purpley blue" in layman's terms), makes sense. These photos represent the color fairly accurately. A [Google Image search for MSO Mauvine Blue](https://www.google.com/search?q=mso+mauvine+blue&source=lnms&tbm=isch) reveals that the blue is sometimes not present at all in photographs. If I get the chance again, I'm going to again attempt to get a closeup of the sparkle. I could not include these photos since my cheap polarizer was giving me a good fight focusing.

I am certain that if I see this car again I will be as magnetized to it as I was this go-around, and when I do, I will be determined to capture that sparkle.
