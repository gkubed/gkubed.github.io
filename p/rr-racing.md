These are notes that I've taken for the big brake kit (BBK) setup on my 2015 Scion FR-S. I took these notes to help future-Guyon when some component inevitably needs replacing.

The rotors are from a 2017+ 86/BRZ with the performance package (Part #26700CA000) but are *not* from a 2004 STI - they are too wide. The correct rotors are from a 2008-2017 STI. However, if you purchase regular brand 08-17 STI rotors the bolt pattern will be wrong (5x114.3). DBA dual drills those rotors for 5x100 applications. DBA Part# 42656S-10.
