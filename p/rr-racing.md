These are notes that I've taken for the big brake kit (BBK) setup on my 2015 Scion FR-S. I took these notes to help future-Guyon when some component inevitably needs replacing.

### Rotors

These are the details of the rotors that came with the kits from RR-Racing.

| | Front | Rear
| Diameter | 326mm (12.8") | 315mm (12.4") |
| Thickness | 30mm (1.20") | 20.8mm (0.82") |
| Material | Cast Iron, high carbon | Cast Iron, high carbon |
| Coating | Hat Coating E-Coating -- black high temperature coating | Corrosion resistant electroplating |
| Bracket Material | Aerospace Grade Billet Aluminum | Aerospace Grade Billet Aluminum |
| Compatability | 2004 WRX STI OR a 2017+ 86/BRZ with the performance package. Both have 5x100 lug pattern. | 2017+ 86/BRZ with the performance package (Part #26700CA000) but are *not* from a 2004 STI - they are too wide. The correct rotors are from a 2008-2017 STI. However, if you purchase regular brand 08-17 STI rotors the bolt pattern will be wrong (5x114.3). DBA dual drills those rotors for 5x100 applications. DBA Part# 42656S-10. |
